## <a id="background"></a> :cat2: Background

[Encouraging the use and creation of open source software is one of the ways we
serve our community](https://opensource.envato.com/).

Many of Envato's products are based on free and open-source software. Many
(most) of our products are written in Ruby and use
[Bundler](https://bundler.io/) to manage their dependencies on both open- and
closed-source libraries.

Keeping dependencies up-to-date requires regular work. Some teams automate this,
others do it manually. This project seeks to reduce manual and cerebral labor
to get regular dependency updates into production.

## <a id="installation"></a> :floppy_disk: Installation

    $ gem install unwrappr

## <a id="usage"></a> :blue_book: Usage

To run this in the current working directory use...

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
unwrappr
```

See https://github.com/settings/tokens to set up personal access tokens.

## <a id="development"></a> :hammer: Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## <a id="assumptions"></a> :anchor: Assumptions

- All dependencies are in Git
- Git dependencies have tags matching to gem's versions
- Git is installed on the box running Unwrappr
- The target project has its dependencies managed by bundler
- The box that this executes on has access to push branches to origin
- Annotated PRs are hosted by GitHub
